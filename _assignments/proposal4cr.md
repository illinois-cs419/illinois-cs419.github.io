For the 4 Credit project you must submit a 1 to 2 page proposal.**It should  be submitted as a PDF on Compass.** 
This proposal is worth 2% of of your total course grade.
Please use the paper template at [this link](http://junctionpublishing.org/vgtc/Tasks/camera.html) for formatting. You can change the section headings however you wish.

The proposal should have the following information:

### 1. Project title and team members ###

State your project title and the the names and netids of each memeber.You can work in groups of up to 4 people. Your proposed work should be more ambitious the larger your group. 
You will be expected to track and report what work each member does. Ideally, I would like you to use GitHub
or a similar code management system that will track the work for you.

### 2. Project goal ###

In one paragraph, state the purpose of the project. Broadly, your project should fall into one of the following categories:

+ Implement a video game using Unity or Unreal Engine.
+ Implement an information visualization application using D3.js or VTK.js.
+ Complete a short research project that could, but does not have to, be submitted as a poster and 2 page paper to a computer graphics conference.

Your goal paragraph should pick one of the above areas and then provide some specifics. For example: what kind of game? Or, what data will you visualize and what capabilities will the application have?

### 3. Required materials and technologies ###

Provide a short list of what technologies you expect to use (e.g. JS and VTK.js). Are there assets or data or hardware resources you need to acquire?

### 4. Proposed deliverables and rubric ###

Provide a list of what you will deliver. For an application, it can a list of functions you will implement.
For the research project it can a list of functions and/or a set of experiments you will run. You should assign points to each deliverable indicating the importance of that deliverable to the project. Use a set of 10 total points and divide those up. Imagine you are creating a grading rubric. 

**NOTES:**
+ Only one student per team needs to submit a proposal
+ I will review each proposal and provide feedback by Oct. 19, 2019.
+ It is fine if your eventual project deliverables differ from the original in the end. That can happen. The important thing is to start with a plan.
+ If you are doing something experimental and it doesn't work, that's not a problem. A negative result is still a result you can report on and get full credit provided you made a good faith effort to complete the work successfully.
+ The project will be due on the last day of class Dec. 11, 2019.
+ You will submit a 2-page report along with any code developed for the project.
+ ....ignore the submission instructions below.....
