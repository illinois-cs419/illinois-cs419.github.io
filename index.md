## Overview ##

Interactive Computer Graphics is about the techniques and technologies used to generate synthetic digital imagery in real-time. The main focus of the course will be 3D photorealistic rendering and the current rendering methods used in games and other interactive applications.

The topics we will cover include:
+ Geoemetric modeling
+ Mathematics for animation and rendering
+ Shading and programmable shaders
+ Rasterization
+ Physics simulation
+ Physically-based rendering

We will learn how to implement 3D web applications using WebGL and JavaScript. WebGL shares many of the same characteristics as Vulkan, Direct3D, and other popular low-level graphics APIs, so the skills you learn should be transferable.

## Prerequisites ##
We recommend the following courses and skills:

- [CS 225](https://courses.engr.illinois.edu/cs225/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} - prior general programming experience
- [Math 225](https://math.illinois.edu/resources/department-resources/syllabus-math-225){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} or [Math 415](https://math.illinois.edu/resources/department-resources/syllabus-math-415){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} - basic linear algebra, especially 3D transforms

## Lectures ##

Lectures will be available

## Reading ##

There is no book for the class. Notes and other materials will be posted online.
We do have some suggested books if you need help figuring things out:

![Fundamentals of Computer Graphics 4th Edition by Steve Marschner, Peter Shirley](/img/shirley.jpg){:height="200px" width="160px"}

_Fundamentals of Computer Graphics 4th Edition_ by Steve Marschner, Peter Shirley  
Deals with the theoretical and mathematical aspects of computer graphics. Very readable.

_WebGL Programming Guide: Interactive 3D Graphics Programming with WebGL_  
by Kouichi Matsuda and Rodger Lea  
A bit old now, but pretty easy to read with decent example code.

# Assessments #

## Weekly Quizes ##


## Programming Assignments ##
There will a series of four programming assignments. See the [Assignments page](/assignments) for more details.

### 4 Credit Option ###
If you are taking the course for 4 credits, you will complete an extra project implelementing a ray-tracer.

## Exams ##
This class will have three midterm exams and no final exam. Each exam is 50 minutes long 

- Exam 1: 
- Exam 2: 
- Exam 3: Dec. 9, 2020

The exams will be online using Prairielearn. **They will be synchronous and available from 9am-10am Central Time on the day of the exam**
They are open web - you can use any reference material you wish while taking the exam. You should not collaborate with other people. Any instances of collaboration will be considered a violation of academic integrity and will result in a 0 on the exam and a letter grade reduction in the final course grade. Also, the nature of the exam will make collaboration unhelpful - you will get a better grade working on your own rather than wasting time trying to work together.  

# Grades #
We will post grades on [Compass 2g](https://compass.illinois.edu){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}.

We weight grades as follows:

| | 3 credits | 4 credits |  
| ----- | ------ | ----- |  
| MP 1 | 10% | 5% | 
| MP 2 | 10% | 10% | 
| MP 3 | 10% | 10% | 
| MP 4 | 10% | 5% | 
| Weekly Quizzes| 15%  | 15%  |
| Exam Grade| 45% | 45% |   
| 4 Credit Project | | 10% |  

The course grade cutoffs can be expected to be:

|Percentage lower bound | Grade |  
| ----- | ------ | 
| 98%| A+ |
| 93% | A |  
| 90% | A- |  
| 87% | B+ |  
| 83% | B |  
| 80% | B- |  
| 77% | C+ |  
| 73% | C |  
| 70% | C- | 
| 67% | D+ |  
| 63% | D |  
| 60% | D- |  
| 0%  | F  |
