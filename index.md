## Overview ##

Interactive Computer Graphics is about the techniques and technologies used to generate synthetic digital imagery in real-time. The main focus of the course will be 3D photorealistic rendering and the current rendering methods used in games and other interactive applications.

The topics we will cover include:
+ Geoemetric modeling
+ Mathematics for animation and rendering
+ Shading and programmable shaders
+ Rasterization
+ Physics simulation
+ Physically-based rendering

We will learn how to implement 3D web applications using WebGL and JavaScript. WebGL shares many of the same characteristics as Vulkan, Direct3D, and other popular low-level graphics APIs, so the skills you learn should be transferable.

## Office Hours ##

**Every Thursday at 11am on [ZOOM](https://illinois.zoom.us/j/475317507)**

## Prerequisites ##
We recommend the following courses and skills:

- [CS 225](https://courses.engr.illinois.edu/cs225/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} - prior general programming experience
- [Math 225](https://math.illinois.edu/resources/department-resources/syllabus-math-225){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} or [Math 415](https://math.illinois.edu/resources/department-resources/syllabus-math-415){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} - basic linear algebra, especially 3D transforms

## Lectures ##

## Lecture Quizes ##

## Collaborative Notebooks ##

## Programming Assignments ##
There will a series of four programming assignments. See the [Assignments page](/assignments) for more details.

### 4 Credit Option ###
If you are taking the course for 4 credits, you will complete an extra project implelementing a ray-tracer.

## Exams ##
This class will have three midterm exams and no final exam. Each exam is 50 minutes long 

- Exam 1: 
- Exam 2: 
- Exam 3: 

All exams are closed-everything (no book, notes, calculator, etc.). See the [CBTF policies](https://cbtf.engr.illinois.edu/for-students/policies.html) for more detail.You are responsible for all material covered in lectures and assignments.For DRES accommodations see [CBTF DRES Students](https://cbtf.engr.illinois.edu/for-students/dres-students.html)

## Grades ##
We will post grades on [Compass 2g](https://compass.illinois.edu){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}.

We weight grades as follows:

| | 3 credits | 4 credits |  
| ----- | ------ | ----- |  
| MP 1 | 10% | 10% | 
| MP 2 | 15% | 10% | 
| MP 3 | 15% | 10% | 
| MP 4 | 10% | 10% | 
| In-class Work   | 5%  | 5%  |
| Exam Grade| 45% | 45% |   
| 4 Credit Project | | 10% |  

You can expect the cutoffs to be 

## Textbooks ##

There is no book for the class. Notes and other materials will be posted online.
We do have some suggested books if you need help figuring things out:

![Fundamentals of Computer Graphics 4th Edition by Steve Marschner, Peter Shirley](/img/shirley.jpg){:height="200px" width="160px"}

_Fundamentals of Computer Graphics 4th Edition_ by Steve Marschner, Peter Shirley  
Deals with the theoretical and mathematical aspects of computer graphics. Very readable.

_WebGL Programming Guide: Interactive 3D Graphics Programming with WebGL_  
by Kouichi Matsuda and Rodger Lea  
A bit old now, but pretty easy to read with decent example code.
