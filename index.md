## Overview ##

Production Computer Graphics is about the techniques and technologies used to generate synthetic high quality digital imagery. The main focus of the course will be 3D photorealistic rendering current physically-based rendering methods used in cinematic rendering and games.

The course is project-oriented and over the course of the semester you will implement your own rendering engine capable of generating high quality images. You get to design the scenes you render and choose the advanced rendering effects you wish implement...whether that is procedural generation of another world or animation or using hardware acceleration for real-time ray tracing.

The focus of the course will be on learning things you wish to learn. For example, you can choose any programming language you wish for the assignments. If you want to learn Rust or another new language, this is an opportunity to do so. There will be a few low-stakes quizzes and two exams that you can take more than once, but these really exist just to encourage people to keep pace with the course. The majority of your grade will be based on your creative work.   

This semester, we anticipate having live guest lectures from University of Illinois graduates currently working at NVIDIA, Pixar, and Blizzard. You will have the opportunity to ask people about their work and what their advice is for pursuing work in industry.

### Topics
The topics we will cover include:

+ Basic ray tracing 
+ Path tracing
+ Photon mapping
+ Real-time ray-tracing
+ Volumetric rendering of effects like fog and smoke
+ Fluid simulation
+ Digital material modeling
+ Geometric data structures
+ High Dynamic Range imaging
+ Procedural texture generation
+ Procedural geometry generation
+ Compositing
+ Basic ideas in animation
+ Radiosity
+ Radiometry

#### Prerequisites ####
We recommend the following courses and skills:

- [CS 225](https://courses.engr.illinois.edu/cs225/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} - prior general programming experience
- [Math 225](https://math.illinois.edu/resources/department-resources/syllabus-math-225){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} or [Math 415](https://math.illinois.edu/resources/department-resources/syllabus-math-415){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} - basic linear algebra, especially 3D transforms

## Instructional Content ##

The course will be taught using online lectures along with suggested additional reading materials

#### Lectures ####

+ Lectures will be available as asynchronous video links posted on the [course schedule](https://illinois-cs419.github.io/schedule).  

#### Reading ####

The course will use Pete Shirley's free online books: 
![Fundamentals of Computer Graphics 4th Edition by Steve Marschner, Peter Shirley](/img/shirley.jpg){:height="200px" width="160px"}
[UIUC Library E-book link](https://vufind.carli.illinois.edu/vf-uiu/Record/uiu_8503840)

## Assessments ##

Assigned work will include 4 quizzes, 3 programming assignments, 2 exams and a final project completed as a team.

#### Tri-Weekly Quizes ####
There will be short quizzes on PrairieLearn. These quizzes will be based on the lecture material and will serve as practice for the exams
**Each quiz can be taken repeatedly..you can retake it till you get all the questions correct**

+ **They are due by Friday at midnight of the following week (e.g. Quiz 1 is due by Friday of Week 2).**
+ They can be completed late for 50% credit at any time before Dec. 9.

#### Programming Assignments ####
There will a series of four programming assignments. **We will drop the lowest MP score and base your total programming assignment grade on the 3 highest scores.** See the [Assignments page](/assignments) for more details.

#### 4 Credit Project ####
If you are taking the course for 4 credits, you will complete an extra project implelementing a ray-tracer.

#### Exams ####
This class will have three midterm exams and no final exam. Each exam is on the PrairieLearn platform.

- Exam 1: 9am-10am, Sept. 30, 2020 
- Exam 2: 9am-10am, Nov. 11, 2020
- Exam 3: 9am-10am, Dec. 9, 2020

The exams will be online using Prairielearn. **They will be synchronous and available from 9am-10am Central Time on the day of the exam**
They are open web - you can use any reference material you wish while taking the exam. You should not collaborate with other people. Any instances of collaboration will be considered a violation of academic integrity and will result in a 0 on the exam and a letter grade reduction in the final course grade. Also, the nature of the exam will make collaboration unhelpful - you will get a better grade working on your own rather than wasting time trying to work together.  

## Grades ##
We will post grades on [Compass 2g](https://compass.illinois.edu){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}.

We weight grades as follows:

| | 3 credits | 4 credits |  
| ----- | ------ | ----- |  
| MP 1 | 10% | 10% | 
| MP 2 | 10% | 10% | 
| MP 3 | 10% | 10% |  
| Quizzes| 5%  | 5%  |
| Exam 1| 15% | 15% |
| Exam 2| 15% | 15% |
| Project | 40% | 30% |
| 4 Credit Project | 40% | 30% |

The course grade cutoffs can be expected to be:

|Percentage lower bound | Grade |  
| ----- | ------ | 
| 98%| A+ |
| 93% | A |  
| 90% | A- |  
| 87% | B+ |  
| 83% | B |  
| 80% | B- |  
| 77% | C+ |  
| 73% | C |  
| 70% | C- | 
| 67% | D+ |  
| 63% | D |  
| 60% | D- |  
| 0%  | F  |
