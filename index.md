## Overview ##

Production Computer Graphics is about the techniques and technologies used to generate synthetic high quality digital imagery. The main focus of the course will be 3D photorealistic rendering and the current physically-based rendering methods used in cinematic rendering and games.

Guest lectures

#### Prerequisites ####
We recommend the following courses and skills:

- [CS 225](https://courses.engr.illinois.edu/cs225/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} - prior general programming experience
- [Math 225](https://math.illinois.edu/resources/department-resources/syllabus-math-225){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} or [Math 415](https://math.illinois.edu/resources/department-resources/syllabus-math-415){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} - basic linear algebra, especially 3D transforms

## Instructional Content ##

The course will be taught using online lectures along with suggested additional reading materials

#### Lectures ####

+ **You can attend live lectures at 9am Central Time on Wednesdays at this [Zoom link](https://illinois.zoom.us/j/93019304365?pwd=elBOT0Nrayt2YW1NVlA4NFB2dVR2Zz09)**.
We will focus on actively working through problems and doing code walkthroughs. These lectures will be recorded and available on the [course schedule](https://illinois-cs418.github.io/schedule).

+ Additional lectures will be available as asynchronous video links posted on the [course schedule](https://illinois-cs418.github.io/schedule).  

**You can expect new lectures to be posted by the end of the day on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday.** 

We know attending online synchronous lectures can be difficult, so there is no required attendance. If you can attend the Wednesday lecture, please do so.

#### Reading ####

There is no book for the class. Notes and other materials will be posted online on the [course schedule](https://illinois-cs418.github.io/schedule).
We do have some suggested books:

![Fundamentals of Computer Graphics 4th Edition by Steve Marschner, Peter Shirley](/img/shirley.jpg){:height="200px" width="160px"}

_Fundamentals of Computer Graphics 4th Edition_ by Steve Marschner, Peter Shirley  
Deals with the theoretical and mathematical aspects of computer graphics. Very readable.

_WebGL Programming Guide: Interactive 3D Graphics Programming with WebGL_  
by Kouichi Matsuda and Rodger Lea  
A bit old now, but pretty easy to read with decent example code.

## Assessments ##

Assigned work will include 10 quizzes, 4 programming assignments and 3 exams. there will be an additional project for students taking the course for 4 credits.

#### Weekly Quizes ####
There will be short weekly quizzes on PrairieLearn. These quizzes will be based on the lecture material and will serve as practice for the exams
**Each quiz can be taken repeatedly..you can retake it till you get all the questions correct**

+ **They are due by Friday at midnight of the following week (e.g. Quiz 1 is due by Friday of Week 2).**
+ They can be completed late for 50% credit at any time before Dec. 9.

#### Programming Assignments ####
There will a series of four programming assignments. **We will drop the lowest MP score and base your total programming assignment grade on the 3 highest scores.** See the [Assignments page](/assignments) for more details.

#### 4 Credit Project ####
If you are taking the course for 4 credits, you will complete an extra project implelementing a ray-tracer.

#### Exams ####
This class will have three midterm exams and no final exam. Each exam is on the PrairieLearn platform.

- Exam 1: 9am-10am, Sept. 30, 2020 
- Exam 2: 9am-10am, Nov. 11, 2020
- Exam 3: 9am-10am, Dec. 9, 2020

The exams will be online using Prairielearn. **They will be synchronous and available from 9am-10am Central Time on the day of the exam**
They are open web - you can use any reference material you wish while taking the exam. You should not collaborate with other people. Any instances of collaboration will be considered a violation of academic integrity and will result in a 0 on the exam and a letter grade reduction in the final course grade. Also, the nature of the exam will make collaboration unhelpful - you will get a better grade working on your own rather than wasting time trying to work together.  

## Grades ##
We will post grades on [Compass 2g](https://compass.illinois.edu){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}.

We weight grades as follows:

| | 3 credits | 4 credits |  
| ----- | ------ | ----- |  
| MP 1 | 10% | 10% | 
| MP 2 | 10% | 10% | 
| MP 3 | 10% | 10% |  
| Quizzes| 5%  | 5%  |
| Exam 1| 15% | 15% |
| Exam 2| 15% | 15% |
| Project | 40% | 30% |
| 4 Credit Project | 40% | 30% |

The course grade cutoffs can be expected to be:

|Percentage lower bound | Grade |  
| ----- | ------ | 
| 98%| A+ |
| 93% | A |  
| 90% | A- |  
| 87% | B+ |  
| 83% | B |  
| 80% | B- |  
| 77% | C+ |  
| 73% | C |
